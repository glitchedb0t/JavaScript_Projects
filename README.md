<h2>Pizza Menu</h2>
<p>This project is a menu used to order pizza of a few different sizes with a various selection of toppings. It will take the information the user inputs and calculate the price for the order.</p>

<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h2>
<p>The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first and then users take turns until one successfully gets three in a row or a draw is called. Users can decide which token each player wants to use and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.</p>

<h2>Calculator</h2>
<p>A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.</p>

<h2>To-Do App</h2>
<p>Users are able to input their to do item and create a list of things to check off. Items can be deleted as they are completed by pressing an x (clear) button.</p>
